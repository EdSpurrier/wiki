# Forking and Renaming a Repository in GitHub

In this guide, you will learn how to make a copy of a repository owned by your organization and add a specific prefix to its name, such as `<team_name>-<repository_name>`.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the repository owned by your organization that you want to fork.

2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository's page.

## Step 2: Transfer the Repository to Your Organization

1. After forking the repository, go to your forked repository's page.

2. Click the "Settings" tab on the right-hand side, just above the list of files in the repository.

3. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section.

4. Find the "Transfer repository" option and click on it.

5. In the "Transfer ownership of repository" section, select your organization from the dropdown list.

6. Confirm the transfer, and the repository will be moved to your organization's account.

## Step 3: Rename the Repository

1. Once the repository is in your organization's account, you can rename it with the desired `<team_name>-` prefix.

2. Click on the "Settings" tab of the repository.

3. In the "Repository details" section, edit the "Name" field to add the prefix to the repository name, e.g., `<team_name>-<repository_name>`.

4. Click the "Rename" button to save the new name.

You have successfully forked a repository owned by your organization, transferred it to your organization's account, and added the desired prefix to its name.
